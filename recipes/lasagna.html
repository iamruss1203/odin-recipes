        <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
        <img src="/images/lasagna/cook meat.webp" alt="Cook Meat">
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
