    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>    
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>    
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>    
        <li>¾ pound baby carrots</li>    
        <li>½ pound baby potatoes, halved</li>    
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>    
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>    
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Season chicken thighs with paprika, salt, and pepper.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs skin-side down in the skillet and cook, without moving, until golden brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Flip thighs over and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Add potatoes, cut side down, and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrots and onions and cook until onions are soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup chicken broth, scraping up all the browned bits.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Dissolve corn starch in 1/4 cup chicken broth and pour into the skillet. Stir until well combined.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Place chicken thighs over vegetables, cover, and cook until carrots are tender and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.</p>
